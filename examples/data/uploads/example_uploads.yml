  title: Electronic structure code input and output files
  description: |
    This upload demonstrate the basic use of NOMAD's *parsers*. For many *electronic
    structure codes* (VASP, etc.), NOMAD provides parsers. You simply upload
    the *input and output files* of your simulations and NOMAD parsers are extracting
    all necessary metadata to produce a **FAIR** dataset.

  title: Electronic Lab Notebook
  description: |
    This example contains a custom NOMAD *schema* to create an **Electronic
    Lab Notebook (ELN)** and a few example *data* entries that use this schema.
    The schema demonstrates the basic concepts behind a NOMAD ELN and can be a good
    **starting point** to create you own schemas that model **FAIR data** acquired in your lab.

  title: Tabular Data
  description: |
    This upload demonstrates the used of tabular data. In this example we use an *xlsx*
    file in combination with a custom schema. The schema describes what the columns
    in the excel file mean and NOMAD can parse everything accordingly to
    produce a **FAIR** dataset.
