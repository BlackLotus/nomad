This upload demonstrates the used of tabular data. In this example we use an *xlsx* file in combination with a custom schema. The schema describes what the columns in the excel file mean and NOMAD can parse everything accordingly to produce a **FAIR** dataset.

The schema is meant as a starting point. You can download the schema file and
extend the schema for your own tables.

Consult our [documentation on the NOMAD Archive and Metainfo](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/archive.html) to learn more about schemas.
