Interface to the NOMAD-coe repository postgres database. This implementation is based on
SQLAlchemy. There are model classes that represent entries in the *users* and *session*
tables.

This module allows to authenticate users based on user password or session tokens.
It allows to access the user data like names and user_id.

.. autoclass:: User
    :members:
    :undoc-members:

.. autoclass:: Session
    :members:
    :undoc-members:

.. autofunction:: ensure_test_user

This module also provides functionality to add parsed calculation data to the db:

.. autoclass:: UploadMetaData
    :members:
.. autoclass:: Upload
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
.. autoclass:: Calc
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
